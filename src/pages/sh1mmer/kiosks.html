    <h3>Enabling Developer Mode</h3>
      <p>
        Press the power button (⏻), reload key (↻), and ESC key at the same time to 
        enter the recovery screen. It'll look like one of the images below:
      </p>
        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_black.png" />
        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_white.png" />
      <p>
        On this screen, press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> at the same time, then press enter 
        to enable developer mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        After around six minutes of loading dev mode, press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> at the 
        same time again to get past of the developer screen and onto ChromeOS. 
        The screen should look like one of the images below:
      </p>
        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/devmode_black.png" />
        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/devmode_white.png" />
      <p>
        After pressing <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> on the previous screen, you should now
        be loading into ChromeOS with developer mode!
      </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Powerwashing</h3>
      <p>
        If you just enabled developer mode, your Chromebook should already be
        powerwashed, so you won't need to proceed with this step.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already had developer mode enabled and have data, you will need
        to powerwash the Chromebook again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sign out of your account, then press <kbd>CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R</kbd> at 
        the same time on the account selection screen, or log in screen. It should
        look like the image below:
      </p>
        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/powerwash.png" />
      <p>
        From here, press "Powerwash" and proceed with the on-screen instructions and 
        let it finish.
      </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Re-Enrollment</h3>
      <p>
        Go through the setup process and you should end up at this screen below:
      </p>  
        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/enrollment.png" />
      <p>
        Press the "Enterprise Enrollment" button and log in with your school 
        account to re-enroll into the Chromebook.
      </p>
