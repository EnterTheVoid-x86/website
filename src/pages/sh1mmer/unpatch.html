    <h3>How to use SH1mmer after the patch</h3>
    <h4>(This will require you to remove components off your Chromebook)</h4>
    <h5>
      if this isn't working for you, use: <a
      href="https://fog.gay">E-Halcyon</a> instead.</h5>
    <hr />
      <h3>What you'll need</h3>
        <li>
          <u onclick="alert(messages.screw)">A screwdriver</u>; this is needed to open
          up the Chromebook.
        </li>
        <li>
          <u onclick="alert(messages.brain)">A brain</u>; note that it has to be competent 
          alongside being there.
        </li>
    <hr />
      <h3>Battery Disassembly</h3>
        <p>
          First, you'll need to unplug everything in the Chromebook, such as
          the charger, any USB devices, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take your <u onclick="alert(messages.screw)">screwdriver</u> and open the 
          back panel of your Chromebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find the battery cable and unplug it from the Chromebook, this should disable
          the Write Protection on the majority of supported Chromebooks w/ SH1mmer.
        </p>
          <i>
            p.s: if you're on <kbd>dedede</kbd>, your WP method may be different.
          </i>
        <p>
          Plug in the charger, and turn on the Chromebook. Yes, this will work as the
          Chromebook will run from the power of the charger.
        </p>
      <hr />
        <h3>Using SH1mmer</h3>
          <p>
            Boot into SH1mmer using your preferred method of choice (USB, SD Card, etc)
            and use "Un-Enroll / Deprovision". This <b>WILL ERROR</b> but we'll ignore
            that for now.
          </p>
            <i>
              if you're using an old & legacy version, you'll need to run
              <kbd>Disable block_devmode</kbd> alongside everything else.
            </i>
          <p>
            Go into the Bash Shell by using "Open Bash" and execute the following
            commands below: <br>
            <kbd>/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090</kbd>
          </p>
          <p>
            After using this command, <b>DO NOT USE "Reset GBB Flags"</b> as you'll
            fuck things up if you do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exit SH1mmer and turn off your Chromebook. Unplug everything including the
            charger, reconnect the battery, and then reconnect the charger.
          </p>
      <hr />
        <h3>ChromeOS Commands</h3>
          <p>
            Boot up your Chromebook and press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> to enter ChromeOS
            in a developer mode state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once it completes and boots into ChromeOS, press 
            <kbd>CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R</kbd> to powerwash the Chromebook.
          </p>
          <p>
            After powerwashing, immediately go into the ChromeOS shell by pressing
            <kbd>CTRL + ALT + F2 (→)</kbd>. Log into the user as: <kbd>root</kbd>, then
            run the following commands: <br>
            <kbd>tpm_manager_client take_ownership</kbd> <br>
            <kbd>cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters</kbd>
          </p>
            <i>
              both of these commands should report "success". if not, there has been an 
              error and you need to use <a href="https://fog.gay">E-Halycon</a> instead.
            </i>
          <p>
            Press <kbd>CTRL + ALT + F1 (←)</kbd> to exit out of the shell, then press 
            <kbd>CTRL + ALT + Shift + R</kbd> to powerwash the Chromebook again.
          </p>
      <hr />
        <h3>Aftermath</h3>
          <p>
            After powerwashing the Chromebook again and going through the setup, the
            Chromebook <i>should</i> no longer re-enroll and you may use it as a
            normal laptop.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will only ever have to do this once, and this will let you use
            SH1mmer even after it has been <b>completely patched.</b>
