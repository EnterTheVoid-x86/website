    <h3>How to use SH1mmer after the patch</h3>
    <h4>(This will require you to remove the back cover off your Chromebook)</h4>
      <p>you'll only need to do this once, and it will let you use SH1mmer even after it's been completely patched</p>
      <pre>
  
        1. unplug everything, open the back panel, disconnect the battery to disable WP, plug in the charger
        2. boot into SH1mmer and use "Un-Enroll" / "Deprovision" (it'll error but ignore that)
        (you will also need to run "Disable block_devmode" if you're using the old legacy version)
        3. go to the bash shell and run this command:
        <kbd>/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090</kbd>
        <i>> do not use "Reset GBB Flags" after this</i>
        4. exit SH1mmer, unplug everything, reconnect the battery, reconnect the charger
        5. boot up, press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> to enter developer mode
        6. once it completes, use <kbd>CTRL + ALT + Shift + R</kbd> to powerwash
        7. after powerwash, immediately go to the <kbd>CTRL + ALT + F2 (→)</kbd> shell, login as "root" and run these commands:
        <kbd>tpm_manager_client take_ownership</kbd>
        <kbd>cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters</kbd>
        <i>> both commands should report success, otherwise there has been an error and you should downgrade to v110 or lower</i>
        8. press <kbd>CTRL + ALT + F1 (←)</kbd>, use <kbd>CTRL + ALT + Shift + R</kbd> to powerwash again
        9. profit

        NOTE: if you're on dedede, your WP method is probably different. look your model up online to find the WP
        method.
