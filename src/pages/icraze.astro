        <h1>iCraze: A Malware Distributor</h1>
        <font size="+1"
          ><p>
            iCraze was a well-known developer of iOS jailbreak tweaks. He was
            known for his high-quality tweaks and his willingness to help other
            developers. However, in 2023, it was revealed that iCraze had been
            putting malware in his tweaks. The malware was designed to steal
            users' personal information, such as their device information,
            passwords, and location. iCraze was quickly exposed and banned from
            the jailbreak acommunity.
            <br />
            <br />
             The iCraze malware scandal was a major blow to the jailbreak
            community. It showed that even trusted developers could be
            compromised. As a result of the scandal, many users became more
            cautious about installing tweaks from unknown sources.
            <br />
            <br />
             The iCraze malware scandal also had a significant impact on the iOS
            jailbreak scene. It led to a decline in the number of jailbreak
            tweaks being developed and released. It also made it more difficult
            for users to find safe and reliable jailbreak tweaks.
            <br />
            <br />
             This should be a reminder to YOU that even the most trusted
            developers can be compromised. It is important to be vigilant when
            installing tweaks from unknown sources and to only install tweaks
            from trusted developers or repositories. You should also remove any
            repos or tweaks that have a warning in Sileo.

              Nexus is an iOS 16-inspired lock screen customization tweak that
              is meant to surpass much worse tweaks such as
              <a href="https://havoc.app/package/aim">AIM</a> and
              <a href="https://havoc.app/package/aimpro">AIM Pro</a>. However on
              March 14, 2023, iCraze created an update which was meant to be
              some small "fixes and changes". This included a piece of malware
              which infected every device who had updated to that version of
              Nexus at the time.

              Hestia is a jailbreak detection bypasser, being similar to other
              tweaks such as A-Bypass and Shadow. However on December 10, 2022,
              iCraze published an update to the Hestia tweak on Havoc which was
              meant to fix a preference issue on
              <a href="https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15">XinaA15</a>. This
              update happened to also include a piece of malware in the code
              which infected all devices running iOS 15.0 up to 15.1.1.

              Custom Player is a tweak that allowed an end-user to easily modify
              their music player. On February 14, 2022, this was one of, if not
              the first tweak, to get injected with the "iCraze Malware" which
              made all devices that had Custom Player installed start to slow
              down. This slowdown would drastically get worse as the user kept
              using their phone by the minute, and after 10 minutes the device
              would go into a
